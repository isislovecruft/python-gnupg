# python-gnupg #

Fork of [python-gnupg-0.3.2](https://code.google.com/p/python-gnupg/), patched
to fix a potential vulnerability which could result in remote code execution,
due to unsanitised inputs being passed to ```subprocess.Popen([...], shell=True)```.

### Installation ###

#### From [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org) ####
It's simple. Just do:
```
[sudo] pip install gnupg
```

#### From this git repository ####
To install this package from this git repository, do:

```
git clone https://github.com/isislovecruft/python-gnupg.git
cd python-gnupg
make install
make test
```

Optionally to build the documentation after installation, do:
```
make docs
```

To get started using python-gnupg's API, see the [online documentation](https://python-gnupg.readthedocs.org/en/latest/),
and import the module like so:
```
>>> import gnupg
```

The primary interface class you'll likely want to interact with is
[```gnupg.GPG```](https://python-gnupg.readthedocs.org/en/latest/gnupg.html#gpg):
```
>>> gpg = gnupg.GPG(binary='/usr/bin/gpg',
...     homedir='./keys',
...     keyring='pubring.gpg',
...     secring='secring.gpg')
>>> batch_key_input = gpg.gen_key_input(
...     key_type='RSA',
...     key_length=4096)
>>> print batch_key_input
Key-Type: RSA
Name-Email: isis@wintermute
Key-Length: 4096
Name-Real: Autogenerated Key
%commit

>>> key = gpg.gen_key(batch_key_input)
>>> print key.fingerprint
